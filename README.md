Traffic congestion poses significant challenges in urban areas, necessitating effective prediction and management strategies. This project focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques for traffic prediction to mitigate congestion. By analysing historical traffic data and applying ML algorithms such as Random Forest, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting and Neural Networks, this study aims to develop accurate traffic prediction models. The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a web-based application. The outcome will provide valuable insights for traffic planners and city administrators to proactively manage and optimise traffic flow, thereby addressing congestion issues.
